## 🔍 Quick Status Check

I'm about to consolidate the vibe repos (merge + rename). Before I do, I need to know what you're working on.

**Please report:**

1. **Which directory are you in?**
   ```bash
   pwd
   ```

2. **What are you working on?** (1-2 sentences)

3. **Git status - what's changed?**
   ```bash
   git status --short
   ```

4. **Are you in the middle of something critical?**
   - [ ] Yes - need 10-30 min to finish
   - [ ] No - can pause now
   - [ ] Just finished - ready to commit

5. **Any uncommitted work?**
   ```bash
   git diff --stat
   ```

6. **Should I commit your work or do you want to?**
   - [ ] Commit it for me (describe what it is below)
   - [ ] Let me commit it myself
   - [ ] It's already committed

---

**Please paste your responses here so I can coordinate the merge.**

Thanks! This helps ensure we don't lose anyone's work during the consolidation.
