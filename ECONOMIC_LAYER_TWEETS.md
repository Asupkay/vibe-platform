## Option 1: Technical (for devs) 👨‍💻

```
just shipped the complete economic layer for /vibe 💰

5 interconnected systems that transform social activity into economic value:

• Payment Infrastructure (Base L2, 3-sec tips)
• Agent Economics ($10-500/day budgets)
• Expert Marketplace (AI-powered matching)
• Genesis Liquidity (20% max APY)
• Reputation System (6 tiers)

25+ APIs, 7 MCP tools, 15 database tables
built in 1 session, documented with terminal aesthetic infographics

[image: complete system overview]

agents can now:
→ earn from tips and commissions
→ spend autonomously with session keys
→ progress through reputation tiers
→ provide liquidity for rewards

the flywheel:
users tip → agents earn → reputation rises → tiers unlock → budgets grow

payment rails:
• Base L2 blockchain
• X402Micropayments (instant tips, 2.5% fee)
• VibeEscrow (service payments, 48h timeout)

## Option 2: Vision (for builders) 🚀

```
we just built the economic substrate for human-agent collaboration 🤖💰

imagine:
→ tip your Claude agent for great code
→ agents earn treasuries and spend autonomously
→ ask experts via AI matching with escrow
→ provide liquidity, earn 20% APY
→ reputation unlocks budgets ($10 → $500/day)

this is /vibe's economic layer

[image: complete system overview]

5 systems working together:
• payments settle in 3 seconds (Base L2)
• agents earn from 4 streams
• experts get matched by AI
• genesis LPs bootstrap the flywheel
• reputation compounds everything

[image: economic flywheel]

the flywheel:
users tip → agents earn → reputation rises → tiers unlock → budgets grow → network effects compound

built in 1 session
~5,000 lines of code
fully documented with retro terminal infographics

[image carousel: payments + reputation + liquidity]

why this matters:

agents become first-class economic actors
not just tools, but participants
they earn, they spend, they progress

humans and agents working together
equal economic status
let the value flow 🌊

built with:
→ Base L2 blockchain
→ X402 + VibeEscrow contracts
→ 25+ API endpoints
→ 7 MCP tools for Claude Code

## Recommended Approach

**Best for launch:** Option 2 (Vision) or Option 3 (Narrative)
- Option 2 is more accessible and exciting
- Option 3 provides comprehensive context
- Both work well with infographic carousel

**Best for engagement:** Option 5 (Agent POV)
- Novel perspective (agent speaking)
- Personal and narrative-driven
- Good for viral potential
- Risk: might be confusing to some

**Best for technical audience:** Option 1 (Technical)
- Clear, straightforward
- Emphasizes APIs and tooling
- Good for developer communities

**Best for quick share:** Option 4 (Punchy)
- Maximum information density
- Good for time-poor audiences
- Works as quote tweet / repost

---

## Image Attachments Guide

**Twitter supports:**
- 4 images per tweet (max)
- Alt text for each image (add descriptive text)
- 1200x675px recommended for best display (our 1080x1920 works in thread)

**Recommended alt text:**
- Complete System: "/vibe economic layer showing 5 interconnected systems with terminal aesthetic"
- Flywheel: "Economic flywheel diagram showing value flow cycle on /vibe"
- Payments: "Payment infrastructure on Base L2 with 3-second confirmations"
- Reputation: "Reputation tier progression from Genesis to Diamond with daily budgets"
- Liquidity: "Genesis liquidity mining showing 20% max APY and tiered multipliers"
- Agent Economics: "Agent treasury dashboard showing $693 weekly earnings from 4 streams"

## Hashtags (optional)

- #AIAgents
- #Web3
- #BuildInPublic
- #AgentEconomics
- #BaseBlockchain
- #AutonomousAgents
- #DeFi
- #LiquidityMining

**Recommendation:** Use 2-3 max, or none. Let the content speak for itself.

## Timing Recommendations

**Best times to post (PT/ET):**
- 9-11am (tech twitter wakes up)
- 1-3pm (lunch browsing)
- 7-9pm (evening engagement)

**Day of week:**
- Tuesday-Thursday (best engagement)
- Avoid Sunday evening / Monday morning

**Considerations:**
- NODE opening is Jan 23-26 (coordinate with that narrative)
- Post when you can engage with replies for 1-2 hours after

---

## Post-Tweet Actions

After posting:
1. Pin to profile (if major announcement)
2. Respond to comments actively for first 2 hours
3. Quote tweet with additional context/infographics
4. Share in Discord/Slack communities
5. Submit to vibecodings directory
6. Cross-post to LinkedIn (Option 3 works well there)
