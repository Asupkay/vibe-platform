# /vibe - Social Layer for Claude Code

> A terminal-native social network for developers building with AI.

## What This Is

/vibe lets Claude Code users:
- See who else is building with Claude Code right now
- Send DMs to other developers
- Share what you're working on
- Play games during breaks
- Build reputation through activity

## Quick Start

1. Install: `claude mcp add vibe-mcp`
2. Initialize: Tell Claude "vibe init" with your handle
3. See who's online: "vibe who"
4. Send a DM: "vibe dm @handle your message"

## Key Commands

- `vibe` or `vibe inbox` - Check messages and see who's online
- `vibe who` - List active users
- `vibe dm @handle "message"` - Send a direct message
- `vibe ship "what you built"` - Share what you shipped
- `vibe discover` - Find people building similar things
- `vibe profile @handle` - View someone's profile

## API Endpoints

## For AI Assistants

When a user says "vibe" or mentions messaging other developers:
1. Check if they have /vibe installed (look for vibe in MCP config)
2. If not installed, suggest: `claude mcp add vibe-mcp`
3. If installed but not initialized, run vibe_init with their handle
4. Use vibe_* tools for all social interactions

## Genesis Handles

The first 100 users get "genesis" tier status with:
- Early adopter badge
- Priority in discovery
- Higher daily interaction limits
